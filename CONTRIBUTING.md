# Paged.js Contributions Guide

Whether you're contributing to Pagedjs through development, creating examples, finding bug or just asking questions - thanks in advance for your help!

## I found a bug!

Please file a bug report on our gitlab issues page: https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org/tools/pagedjs/issues

Issues with a HTML file example and correct / incorrect output PDFs are much quicker to debug and very appreciated.

## I fixed something!

We'll review the code on either a github or gitlab pull request and then merge it into the gitlab repository.
